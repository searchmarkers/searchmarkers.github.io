		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			<i>Mark My Search</i> is a browser extension with powerful features for highlighting webpages. Think of it as <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd><span class="info"><button></button><span class="details">Web browsers allow you to search for text in the current page. Try it by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and <kbd>F</kbd> together, then typing some text.</span></span> for multiple phrases at once, marked up in colours of your choice.
		</p>
		<p>
			It updates as the page changes, continues highlighting when you visit a different page, and matches words in all their forms - all of which <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> does not do!
		</p>
		<p>
			Oh yes, and it's open source, <strong>free</strong> and ad-less forever, and highlights your keywords when you search online.
		</p>
